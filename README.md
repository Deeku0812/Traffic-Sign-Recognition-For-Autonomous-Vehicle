# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-For-Autonomous-Vehicle

# Edx Certification Program

### Intuition

In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.


### About Project
In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.


### DataSets
Link - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VAZrvMSBjnbPNTA2xuz-IY7u08sqpzNP?usp=sharing
The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes.

The dataset has a Traffic_sign folder which contains images inside each class and a Test folder which we will use for testing our model.

### Model
We built and trained the CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) model with train image dataset

#### Step
1. Dataset Pre-Proccessing
2. Build a CNN model
3. Train and validate the model
4. Test the model with test dataset

### Result
model got a 95% accuracy on the training dataset.
